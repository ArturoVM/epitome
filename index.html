					<h3>Simple & Minimal</h3>
					<p>No complicated sorting algorithms. No useless social bells and whistles.</p>
					<p>Pond focuses on doing one thing well: synchronizing your feeds across devices and apps.</p>
					<p>Extra care is taken to give it a very small footprint.</p>

					<h3>Elegant</h3>
					<p>Code, that is.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: center">Q&A</h2>
				<h3>What?</h3>
				<p>Pond is a simple, elegant, self–hosted RSS+Atom feed sync solution.</p>
				<h3>Why?</h2>
				<p>With the recent announcement of the death of Google Reader, many alternatives have been popping up, but—to the extent of my knowledge—none of them is self–hosted <em>and</em> open source.</p>
				<h3>How?</h2>
				<p>Pond is written in Go and uses SQLite for storage.</p>
				<h3>Can I install Pond on my commodity server?</h3>
				<p>No. Currently, because of the technology stack, it can only be deployed to VPSes, but if enough people request it, and the project gets enough collaborators, a PHP port might get written.</p>
				<h3>I installed Pond—now how do I read my feeds?</h3>
				<p>Pond, on its own, is pretty much useless for that purpose. It is intended to provide the necessary infrastructure to sync your feeds across readers and devices.</p>
				<p>To read your feeds, you'll need a reader that supports Pond. If you are a developer, I encourage you to read the API documentation, and consider integrating Pond into your reader.</p>
				<p>In the future, a front–end app to read your feeds might get built. No promises, though.</p>
